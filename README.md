## 1. Project Overview
The goal of this project is to address the critical business problem of employee turnover. By leveraging historical employee data, we have built a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of an employee leaving the company. This predictive model is integrated into a user-friendly web dashboard that also provides rich visualizations for exploring the key factors driving attrition.

## 2. Key Features
- **Executive Dashboard:** A high-level overview of key HR metrics and visualizations on attrition drivers like department, income, job satisfaction, overtime, and demographics.
- **Predictive Modeling:** An interactive tool to predict attrition for an individual employee by inputting their details.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** A rich set of interactive charts to help HR teams understand *why* employees are leaving.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and simple UI built with Streamlit, requiring no technical expertise to use.

## 3. Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly Express
- **Model Persistence**: Joblib

## 7. Detailed Project Report

### 7.1. The Business Problem
Employee attrition is a costly problem for any organization. Losing an employee results in costs related to recruitment, onboarding, and lost productivity. The goal of this project is to mitigate these costs by building a tool that can proactively identify employees who are at a high risk of leaving, allowing management to intervene with targeted retention strategies.

### 7.2. Data & Feature Engineering
The model was trained on a historical employee dataset. Key steps in data preparation included:

- **Cleaning**: Handling missing values and removing irrelevant columns.
- **Encoding**: Converting categorical features (e.g., Department, MaritalStatus) into a numerical format using one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features by binning continuous variables like Age and YearsAtCompany to help the model capture non-linear trends.
- **Balancing**: Addressing the class imbalance (fewer employees leave than stay) using techniques like class_weight to ensure the model learns effectively from the minority class.

### 7.3. Modeling & Evaluation
Several classification algorithms were tested, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Models were evaluated based on their F1-Score, Precision, and Recall, with a strong focus on the model's ability to correctly identify employees who will leave (the positive class). After extensive experimentation, a Logistic Regression model provided the best and most balanced performance.

### 7.4. Final Model Performance
The selected Logistic Regression model achieved the following performance on the test set:

| Metric     | Score | Interpretation                                                |
|------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Accuracy   | 91%   | Overall, the model correctly classifies 91% of all employees.|
| Precision  | 84%   | When the model predicts an employee will leave, it is correct 84% of the time.|
| Recall     | 55%   | The model successfully identifies 55% of all employees who actually leave.|
| F1-Score   | 67%   | The model achieves a healthy balance between Precision and Recall.|

This represents a strong, practical model. It significantly reduces the number of "false alarms" (low precision) while still identifying over half of all at-risk employees.

### 7.5. Understanding the Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions versus the actual outcomes on the test data.

|                 | Predicted: Stays | Predicted: Leaves |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------------|
| **Actual: Stays**   | 312 (True Negative) | 8 (False Positive)  |
| **Actual: Leaves**  | 26 (False Negative) | 22 (True Positive)   |

- **True Positives (2)**: The model correctly identified 22 employees who were going to leave.
- **False Positives (8)**: The model incorrectly flagged 8 employees as leaving, but they stayed.
- **False Negatives (26)**: The model missed 26 employees who left.

### 7.6. Key Insights from the Dashboard
The interactive visualizations on the dashboard revealed several key drivers of attrition:

- **Overtime**: Employees who work overtime have a significantly higher rate of attrition.
- **Monthly Income**: Attrition is more common among employees in lower income brackets.
- **Job Satisfaction**: As job satisfaction decreases, the rate of attrition steadily increases.
- **Age**: Younger employees, particularly those in their late 20s and early 30s, show a higher tendency to leave.

## 8. Deployment
